# Snake Reinforcement Learning Project using Q-Learning


My goal of this project is to teach a program how to play snake and eventually reach a super-human level of accuracy and wins.

This program was written from scratch and not built on top or inspired by another project.

### Requirements
Python 2 or 3\
`pip install turtle`\
`pip install tqdm`\
`pip install os`




### How to start
Run Snake_RL.py to start the game and watch the snake learning.
